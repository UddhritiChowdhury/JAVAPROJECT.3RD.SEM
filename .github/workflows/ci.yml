        java-version: '11'

    - name: Build with Maven
    -  run: mvn -B package --file project/pom.xml
- Commit changes (summary: Point CI to project/pom.xml).
B — Quick debug alternative (compile with javac)- Edit .github/workflows/ci.yml.
- Replace the Maven build step block with these exact lines:
      - name: Compile Java
        run: |
          find . -name "*.java" > sources.txt
          javac -d out @sources.txt
      - name: Run Main (optional)
        run: java -cp out com.uddhriti.superstore.Main
- Commit changes (summary: Use javac for CI debug).
- Open Actions → view the run → read the javac output to fix package or compile errors.
Quick verification checklist (after you commit)- Confirm repo root shows a file named exactly: pom.xml.
- Open Actions → latest Java CI run → if it still fails, copy the first 8–12 lines of the failing step log and paste them here.
If you want, I will now produce:- a different pom.xml if your Main class has another package/name, or
- the exact one-line edit to .github/workflows/ci.yml if your pom.xml lives in a specific subfolder — tell me the subfolder name.
